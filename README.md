# Plasmid
Plasmid is a library for creating server-side minigames with Fabric.
Plasmid intends to do all the boring work relating to minigame implementation, to rather allow focus effort on just the game itself.

Check out our [wiki](https://github.com/NucleoidMC/plasmid/wiki/Getting-Started) for instructions on how to get started using Plasmid!  

Alternatively, you can find many examples of games implemented with Plasmid on the [Nucleoid Organisation](https://github.com/NucleoidMC), or even join and play them on our Minecraft server at `nucleoid.xyz`.

You can also find us on our [Discord](https://nucleoid.xyz/discord) if you have any troubles or queries, or would like to get involved.
